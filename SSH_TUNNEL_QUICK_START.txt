=== SSH Tunnel Quick Start ===

To set up SSH tunnel, run this command in a NEW PowerShell window:

ssh -L 5432:127.0.0.1:5432 YOUR_USERNAME@31.97.34.56

Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your VPS username.

Common usernames: root, ubuntu, admin, or your custom username

Example:
ssh -L 5432:127.0.0.1:5432 root@31.97.34.56

After running the command:
1. Enter your VPS password when prompted
2. Keep that terminal window OPEN
3. Come back to this terminal and run: npm run dev

The tunnel will forward local port 5432 to your VPS database.
